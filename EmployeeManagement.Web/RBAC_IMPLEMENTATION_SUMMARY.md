## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Backend Protection
```csharp
// Every endpoint checks permissions
var currentUser = await GetCurrentUserAsync();
if (!_authService.HasPermission(currentUser, Permissions.EditEmployees))
{
    return Forbid();
}
```

### Frontend Adaptation
```javascript
// Buttons only shown if permitted
{currentUser?.permissions?.includes('Employees.Add') && (
    <button onClick={handleAddEmployee}>Add Employee</button>
)}
```

### JWT Token Claims
- User ID
- Username
- Email
- **Role** (new)
- **Role Level** (new)

---

## 💾 Data Storage

### users.json Structure
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "passwordHash": "...",
  "fullName": "Admin User",
  "role": 5,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-14T11:30:00Z",
  "lastLogin": "2025-10-14T11:35:00Z"
}
```
