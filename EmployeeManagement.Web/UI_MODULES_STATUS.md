## 🛠️ What's Next

I can build the remaining 6 UI pages:

- Training UI (Course catalog, enrollment management)
- Asset Management UI (Asset inventory, assignment tracking)
- Helpdesk UI (Ticket system, knowledge base)
- Offboarding UI (Resignation workflow, exit interviews)

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours for all 6 pages

### Option 2: Use Current Setup

- All backend functionality working perfectly

### Option 3: Priority-Based
Build UI for only the most important modules:
1. **Attendance** (most used daily)
2. **Training** (employee development)
3. **Asset Management** (equipment tracking)
