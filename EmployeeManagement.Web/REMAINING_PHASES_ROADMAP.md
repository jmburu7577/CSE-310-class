    public string Action { get; set; }
    public string Entity { get; set; }

    public string? OldValues { get; set; }
    public string? NewValues { get; set; }
    public string IpAddress { get; set; }
}
```

### Estimated Time: 1-2 weeks

---

## üìã Phase 7: Database Migration (CRITICAL)

### Why This Is Important
- **Scalability:** JSON files won't scale beyond hundreds of records
- **Performance:** Database queries are much faster
- **Integrity:** Foreign keys and constraints
- **Reliability:** ACID transactions
- **Concurrency:** Multiple users simultaneously
- **Production Ready:** Required for real deployment

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Choose Database
**Recommended:** PostgreSQL (free, open-source, powerful)
**Alternative:** SQL Server

#### Step 2: Add EF Core
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="8.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" Version="8.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL" Version="8.0.0" />
```

#### Step 3: Create DbContext
```csharp
public class EmployeeDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Payslip> Payslips { get; set; }
    public DbSet<LeaveRequest> LeaveRequests { get; set; }
    public DbSet<LeaveBalance> LeaveBalances { get; set; }
    public DbSet<AuditLog> AuditLogs { get; set; }
    
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Configure relationships
        modelBuilder.Entity<Payslip>()
            .HasOne<Employee>()
            .WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(p => p.EmployeeId);
            
        modelBuilder.Entity<LeaveRequest>()
            .HasOne<Employee>()
            .WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(l => l.EmployeeId);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Migrations
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

#### Step 5: Migrate Data
Create a data migration service to move from JSON to database

#### Step 6: Update Services
Replace JSON file operations with EF Core queries

### Benefits
‚úÖ Better performance  
‚úÖ Data relationships  
‚úÖ Transactions  
‚úÖ Concurrent access  
‚úÖ Built-in validation
