## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Open Terminal
**Windows users**: Use **Command Prompt (cmd)**, not PowerShell
- Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- Or search for "Command Prompt" in Start menu

### Step 2: Navigate to Project
```bash
cd C:\Users\BYU\Desktop\CSE-310-class-1\recursive-directory-scanner
```

### Step 3: Install and Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** You should see the scanner analyze the current directory.

## 🎯 Try These Commands

```bash
# Scan the src folder
npm run dev ./src

# Limit depth to 2 levels
npm run dev . --max-depth=2

# Include hidden files
npm run dev . --include-hidden

# Run tests
npm test

# Check code quality
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build

# Get help
npm run dev --help
```

## 🎬 Next Steps for Submission

### 1. Test Everything Works
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev . --max-depth=2
npm test
npm run lint
```

### 2. Record Demo Video
Show these features:
- Installation (`npm install`)
- Running the scanner (`npm run dev`)
- Different options (`--max-depth`, `--include-hidden`)
- The tree output and statistics
- Running tests (`npm test`)
- Running linter (`npm run lint`)
- Quick code walkthrough (show recursion, classes, async)

### 3. Update README.md
- Line 8: Add your YouTube video link
- Replace `http://youtube.link.goes.here` with your actual link

### 4. Update package.json
- Line 14: Add your name as author
- Replace empty string `""` with your name

### 5. Commit to GitHub
```bash
git add recursive-directory-scanner/
git commit -m "Add TypeScript Recursive Directory Scanner module"
git push
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Error?
**Solution**: Use Command Prompt (cmd) instead of PowerShell
- See `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` for details

### "Cannot find module" error?
**Solution**: Run `npm install` first

### Nothing happens?
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the right directory
```bash
cd C:\Users\BYU\Desktop\CSE-310-class-1\recursive-directory-scanner
```
